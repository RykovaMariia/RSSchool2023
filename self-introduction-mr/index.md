"Hello everyone! My name is Masha and I am currently a student in the frontend course at Rolling-Scopes-School. I'd like to share my journey towards becoming a programmer.

If we start from the beginning, I first encountered programming in school, just like many of you. Pascal was my first language and our favorite task was to draw a robot in the console. In grade 11, I even participated in a contest and took the second place in my region, where I was tasked with designing the falling of a ball.

Afterwards, I enrolled in university. In a last-minute switch, I changed my major from Applied Mathematics to Life safety in the technosphere. Why did I do , you may ask? At the time, I was convinced that I wasn't smart enough for programming and it scared me.

 Upon graduating summa cum laude, I ended up working in my field of study in Health and safety Department. It was interesting, but there was always something else pulling me in a different direction.

About a year ago, after moving to another country and realizing how important it is to do what you love, I decided to take action!

Initially, I stumbled upon a software testing course. It seemed like a good fit - not too difficult, but with automation involved. It was an amazing experience. I got to know about software testing, the wonderful language Java, and even improved my soft skills by leading a project.

To give you a brief project overview, we were testing a web application using Selenium with the Page Object Modal pattern. We also incorporated some Agile methods, using Trello for task management and documentation, and splitting tasks into two-week sprints.

While learning about web application testing, I started paying attention to frontend development. I wanted to know more, and in August 2023, I started learning frontend. During this process, someone recommended the Rolling-Scopes-School. Unfortunately, Stage 0 had already started and I had to catch up with the basics before Stage 1.

It was an incredible adventure! Just to give you an idea - in August, I wrote something in HTML for the first time. Naturally, I didn't manage to complete the entire stage. 

And then, at long last, Stage 1 began. I really enjoyed all the practical tasks and I want to thank everyone who contributed to creating them. Despite some complaints, I find it beneficial to both review other people's work - because it often leads to new discoveries - and to receive feedback on my own work, which helps me to improve.

Thank you for your attention
Good luck with your learning journey!"
