## Reflections

1. I was learned that TypeScript a superset of JavaScript,  which means that you can use the JavaScript skills you've already developed along with certain features that were previously unavailable to you. For example, Interfaces, Namespaces, Generics etc.
I acquired the skill of installing typescript, create the config.json file, and  compile code and convert it to JavaScript

2. I learned that the static type system in TypeScript enables to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly. 
I acquired the skill of declare variables using primitive types, using object types, using union and intersection types.

3. I learned that the Interface in TypeScript to describe an object, naming and parameterizing the object's types, and to compose existing named object types into new ones.
I acquired the skill of declare an interface, implement an interface, extending an interface.

4. I learned that TypeScript simplifies the development of functions and makes them easier to troubleshoot by enabling you to type parameters and return values. TypeScript also adds new options for parameters.
I acquired the skill of write functions that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters, define function types using type aliases or interfaces.
